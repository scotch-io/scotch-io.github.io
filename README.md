## WTF?

Jekyll is a simple and blog-aware static site generator built in Ruby. In laymen terms, it's just a tool to let you have **all the cool features of a full-blown CMS without having to worry about managing a database**. This means hosting is *extremely easy* and *scalable* since all you're doing is managing a bunch of files.

This is just a starter theme!


## Getting Started

To start coding away, first clone this repo...

```
git clone https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-io.github.io my-blog
cd my-blog
```

Then run Jekyll (if you don't have Jekyll installed, see the tutorial or docs):

```
jekyll serve
```

Change `url` in `_data/global.yml` to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

Start coding.
